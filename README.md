# NASA Space Apps Challenge 2024

### This repository contains an LLM pipeline for data processing, created as part of a team project for the NASA Space Apps Challenge.

#### Challenge: Community Mapping  
**Description:** A geographic information system (GIS) can create, manage, analyze, and map many types of data. With GIS and other mapping technologies, you can create a map of an area and layer open data over it spatially to reveal new, enriching insights. Your challenge is to create a map that incorporates open science data to explore how an issue in your community is shaped by the surrounding physical geography. Maybe you’re concerned about food deserts and want to analyze the locations of grocery stores in your neighborhood? Or perhaps you’d like to explore the impacts of pollution on the local water supply? There’s so much space for opportunity—all you have to do is map it!
